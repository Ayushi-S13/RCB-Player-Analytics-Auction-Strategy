# 🏏 IPL Auction Player-Value Analysis | SQL + Power BI Report

This project was built to assist Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in planning for the 2017 IPL Mega Auction. Using multi-season IPL data, it identified high-performing players offering better value than their base price. Player statistics were extracted using SQL and visualized using Power BI, then compiled into a summary report.

## 🎯 Objective

- Analyze historical performance data to shortlist reliable, high-impact players  
- Identify undervalued picks by comparing player impact to auction base price  
- Provide insights to support cost-effective and balanced auction decisions

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **MySQL** – to join multi-season datasets and compute batting/bowling metrics  
- **Power BI** – to visually present insights like top performers, strike rates, and value efficiency

---

## 🧮 SQL Highlights

- Extracted player-level stats: runs, strike rate, economy rate, wickets taken  
- Ranked players by performance within roles (batters, bowlers, all-rounders)  
- Used CASE logic to categorize consistency and pricing segments  
- Structured data for visual reporting by role and performance tier
